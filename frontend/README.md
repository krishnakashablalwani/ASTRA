# CampusHive Frontend

This is a minimal Vite + React frontend scaffold for CampusHive.

Quick start:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend expects the backend to be running at `http://localhost:5000` (default). The API baseURL is in `src/services/api.js`.

Next steps:
- Add more pages (events, clubs, announcements).
- Implement full auth flow and token refresh.
- Add environment-based configuration.
